<br><strong>The ToDoApp is based on Kotlin, database Room, pattern MVVM architecture.</strong></br><br>
<b>Android Jetpack</b>
<li>Lifecycle An interface that automatically responds to lifecycle events. </li>
<li>LiveData Data objects that notify views of changes to the underlying database.</li>
<li>ViewModel Data related to the user interface that is not destroyed when the application is rotated. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.</li>
<br><b>DI Hilt</b><br></br>
<li> Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the execution time of manual dependency injection into your project. Performing manual dependency injection requires that you create each class and its dependencies manually, and use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.</li>
<br><b>Fragment</b><br></br>
<li>A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments cannot live on their own--they must be hosted by an activity or another fragment.</li>
<br><b>Room</b></br>
<br>
<li>The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:</li>

<li>Compile-time verification of SQL queries.</li>
<li>Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.</li>
<li>Streamlined database migration paths.</li>
<br><b>Shared Preferences</b></br>
<br>
<li>If you have a relatively small collection of key-values that you'd like to save, you can use the SharedPreferences APIs. A SharedPreferences object points to a file containing key-value pairs and provides simple methods to read and write them. Each SharedPreferences file is managed by the framework and can be private or shared.</li>

<br><b>Unit test</b></br>

<li>Local tests enable you to evaluate your app's logic more quickly. However, not being able to interact with the Android framework creates a limitation in the types of tests you can run.</li>

<li>A unit test verifies the behavior of a small section of code, the unit under test. It does so by executing that code and checking the result.</li>

<li>Unit tests are usually simple but their setup can be problematic when the unit under test is not designed with testability in mind.</li>
